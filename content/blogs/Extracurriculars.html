<p><strong>Golf:</strong> During my first 8 years of life, I lived on a house inside a golf course in Mexico City. Thus, at the age of 5 I started to play golf. After moving to Costa Rica, I continued to play golf at least a couple times per week. By the age of 12 I started to play the sport competitively. Eventually, I classified to represent the Costa Rica U18 team in the Central American Tournament; the biggest of its king of golf. Although nowadays I am not able to practice frequently, I hold a handicap of 8.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming:</strong> At the age of 12 I started to swim frequently. Eventually I was able to qualify to represent my school in the American Schools of Central America tournament in Nicaragua. Due to my performance in this tournament and academic results, I was awarded my school’s Student Athlete Award.</p>
<p><strong>Math Olympics:</strong> Throughout my time in highschool I have also been a Mathlete. I represented my highschool’s math team in various tournaments. Moreover, I am a proud Silver Medal winner of the Costa Rican National Math Olympics. A nationwide contest organized by the Ministry of Education in which +3000 Mathletes participate each year.</p>
<p><strong>Formula 1</strong> For the last 3 years I have gained a strong interest for Formula 1. I have had the opportunity to watch in person 3 Grand Prix. I have always been a fan of Checo Perez and Scuderia Red Bull.</p>
